                <h2 class="h-secondary center">PC Gaming</h2>
                <p class="center">The PC gaming scene is a daunting one to enter. With difficult-to-understand hardware specs, loads of different storefronts, and hundreds of games to play, there’s a lot to look into—it can be a bit overwhelming. But just because you’re interested in PC gaming doesn’t mean you need to spend hours reading into what a graphics card does. You really just need to know the basics at first, which is exactly what we’re covering in this article.

                    There are plenty of reasons to get into PC gaming. Games look and perform best on PC (assuming you spend enough on your hardware to support it) compared to a gaming console, you can use keyboard and mouse to control games (especially good for shooters and strategy games) in addition to controllers, and you also just have more choice when it comes to what to play.
                    
                    But before you can reap those benefits, you need to prepare properly first, so let’s just jump into it.</p>

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Video Gaming</h2>
                <p class="center">Video games are increasing on larger scales today and more and more kids are getting into the craze of playing these games. There are both good and bad games. The industry needs to make a thorough analysis and introduce games that are more innovative and useful so that the damage caused and behavioral patterns do not change, instead bring about good to the coming generations. Too much of gaming would definitely have an impact on people who play for long, the industry has to make sure that good games needs to be introduced, reducing the amount of violence or restricting to the age factor, so that bigger players who understand right from wrong could go for the more harsh games.</p>
